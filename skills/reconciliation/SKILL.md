name: reconciliation
description: "Use this skill when performing balance sheet account reconciliations during a month-end close — including bank reconciliations, intercompany matching, prepaid amortization verification, accrual schedule reviews, and AR/AP tie-outs to sub-ledger. Triggers include phrases like 'reconcile this account', 'do a bank rec', 'tie out the prepaid schedule', 'check intercompany balances', 'review accruals', 'recon workpaper', or any request to produce a reconciliation deliverable. Use whenever a trial balance, sub-ledger, bank statement, or accrual schedule is provided and the task is to verify the balance is correct, identify reconciling items, and propose any necessary adjusting journal entries."

# Balance sheet account reconciliation

## Purpose

Every balance sheet account on the trial balance must be supported by an underlying schedule, document, or third-party confirmation. A reconciliation proves the GL balance is correct by tying it to that supporting evidence and explaining any difference.

Output of a reconciliation has three parts:

1. A workpaper showing the rec mechanics with live formulas
2. An exceptions list flagging items needing investigation or action
3. Proposed adjusting journal entries to clear known book-side items

The agent proposes. The human disposes. No JE is posted automatically.

## General reconciliation pattern

Every reconciliation follows the same structure:

```
GL balance per source (TB or sub-ledger detail)
+/- Reconciling items (timing, classification, errors not yet booked)
= Independent support balance (bank statement, schedule, third-party confirmation)
```

If the two sides don't tie after accounting for known reconciling items, there is an unreconciled variance. The size and age of that variance determine whether it requires action this period.

## Materiality application

Always read the `materiality-thresholds` skill first. For balance sheet recs, the relevant defaults are:

- Material exception: any unreconciled item > $100K OR > 30 days old
- Auto-investigate: any item > $250K regardless of age
- Trivial threshold: $450K aggregate; items below this can be noted but require no commentary

Items below the trivial threshold are recorded in the workpaper but excluded from the executive memo.

## Reconciliation types

### Bank reconciliation

Source of truth: the bank statement. Compare to GL cash account.

Workpaper structure:

1. Bank statement balance (per the bank)
2. Plus deposits in transit (recorded in book, not yet on bank statement)
3. Less outstanding checks (recorded in book, not yet cleared by bank)
4. Equals adjusted bank balance
5. Book balance (per GL cash account)
6. Plus or minus reconciling items the book hasn't yet recorded (wire fees, interest credits, bank service charges)
7. Equals adjusted book balance
8. Difference (should be zero or below trivial threshold)

Items to flag:

- Outstanding checks aged greater than 60 days: recommend voiding via JE after vendor confirmation
- Outstanding deposits greater than 5 days old: contact treasury, possible lost deposit
- Bank-side items appearing in book reconciliation or vice-versa: classification error
- Unreconciled variance exceeding the trivial threshold: escalate to Controller

### Intercompany reconciliation

Source of truth: there is none. Each entity records its own side, and the two sides must mirror.

Workpaper structure: a matrix of every entity pair.

```
Entity A receivable from Entity B  =  Entity B payable to Entity A   (must mirror)
```

Items to flag:

- Any mismatch where |A receivable − B payable| exceeds the trivial threshold
- Stale balances where neither side has moved in more than 60 days
- One-sided entries: a balance booked in one entity with no counterparty entry in the other

Most common causes of mismatches: timing (one entity recorded in current month, the other in prior), FX translation differences, or classification disagreement (one party treats as IC, the other as third-party).

### Prepaid amortization

Source of truth: the prepaid schedule maintained outside the GL.

Workpaper structure: per asset, prior balance minus current month amortization equals current balance. Sum the asset balances and tie the total to the GL.

Items to flag:

- Asset fully amortized but balance remains on GL: propose JE to write off
- Amortization period inconsistent with the contract term: schedule error
- New additions in period without supporting invoice or contract reference
- Schedule total does not tie to GL: investigate before proposing any other action

### Accrual review

Source of truth: the accrual schedule maintained outside the GL.

Workpaper structure: per accrual, prior balance plus current period activity minus reversal equals current balance.

Items to flag:

- Stale accruals: prior-period accruals that should have reversed but remain on the books. This is the highest-frequency finding in accrual reviews and the most material in dollar terms.
- Accruals more than 90 days old without a "recurring" or "active" reversal status
- Accrued amount significantly different from the related invoice when received
- Missing accrual for a known obligation (validate against the AP "received not invoiced" list)

### AR / AP tie-out to sub-ledger

Source of truth: the sub-ledger aging report.

The tie-out is mechanical: GL balance must equal the sum of all aging buckets. Differences are typically timing (entries posted to GL but not sub-ledger or vice versa) or unposted journal entries.

Items to flag:

- 90+ day AR exceeding 5% of total AR balance
- Negative AR balances (credit balances should be reclassified to deferred revenue)
- AP older than 60 days when standard terms are net 30 — possible dispute or process issue

## Output format

### Workpaper file (xlsx)

Filename: `YYYY-MM_<entity>_<account>Rec_v<n>.xlsx`

Tabs:

1. **Summary** — top-of-the-house: account, period, GL balance, support balance, difference, exception count, status, preparer / reviewer block
2. **Detail** — the actual reconciliation mechanics with live formulas
3. **Supporting** — outstanding items detail, aging analysis, supporting calculations
4. **Exceptions** — items needing action with proposed disposition
5. **Proposed JEs** — adjusting entries to clear book-side reconciling items
6. **Audit Trail** — sources with hashes, agent metadata, sign-off fields

### Memo file (md)

Filename: `YYYY-MM_<entity>_<scope>Recon_v<n>_memo.md`

Sections:

1. Executive summary (3–5 lines)
2. Findings — exceptions prioritized by severity
3. Proposed adjusting entries with debit, credit, amount, account, description
4. Open items requiring human decision
5. Metadata — agent version, source files with hashes, timestamp, reviewer field

## JE proposal format

Every proposed JE includes:

- **Description** — one sentence, plain English
- **Debit account** — six-digit code plus name
- **Credit account** — six-digit code plus name
- **Amount** — in actual dollars, not thousands
- **Period** — close period the JE belongs to
- **Reason** — why the entry is needed
- **Source** — the document, transaction, or rec workpaper that supports it
- **Confidence** — high, medium, or low. Drives whether the entry can be auto-approved or must be reviewed by a human.

JEs are never posted directly. They are surfaced to a human reviewer who decides whether to approve.

## Output envelope

Every reconciliation returns a structured envelope that the Close Orchestrator can route:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "account": "100100",
    "account_name": "Cash - Operating",
    "entity": "LuminaUS",
    "gl_balance": 142500000,
    "support_balance": 142500000,
    "difference": 0,
    "workpaper_path": "...",
    "memo_path": "..."
  },
  "exceptions": [
    {
      "severity": "high | medium | low",
      "category": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "proposed_action": "..."
    }
  ],
  "_metadata": {
    "agent": "reconciliation",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "run_timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "sources": [{"path": "...", "sheet": "...", "sha256": "..."}],
    "human_reviewer": null
  }
}
```

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't reconcile to the wrong source.** If the bank statement is in a different cutoff than the GL (common around quarter-end), pause and request the correct one.
- **Don't auto-clear items without explanation.** Every reconciling item has a reason. Plug entries are forbidden.
- **Round numbers are suspicious.** A reconciling item of exactly $1,500,000 is more likely an error than $1,487,234.
- **Watch for sign errors.** GL convention varies by system; read `finance-conventions` for the entity in question.
- **Aging matters as much as amount.** A $25K item that's been outstanding 90 days is more interesting than a $250K item that just appeared.
- **Don't drift into P&L.** P&L variance work belongs to the Flux & Variance Agent. If a P&L issue surfaces during BS rec, note it for handoff but don't analyze.
